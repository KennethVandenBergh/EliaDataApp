Simple Android app that gets data from the Elia website and shows it in an app.

The data is given in XML format at the following URL: http://publications.elia.be/Publications/Publications/ImbalanceNrvPrice.v1.svc/GetImbalanceNrvPrices?day=2016-03-29

A first version of the layout of the Android App is setup. The app contains a button "Test" that activates the method "update". The method "update" connects with the Elia website and reads the XML data. However, this is not working.
